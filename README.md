# pocket2rm
`pocket2rm` is a tool to get articles from read-later platform [pocket](https://app.getpocket.com/) on the [reMarkable paper tablet](https://remarkable.com/). 

- retrieve URLs for articles from pocket (last 10)
- PDFs are downloaded directly, webpages are converted to a [readable format](https://github.com/go-shiori/go-readability) and converted to epub
- runs on reMarkable directly, does not use reMarkable cloud.
- sync is user-triggered (removing synchronization file)

## Prerequisites
- SSH connection with remarkable: [https://remarkablewiki.com/tech/ssh](https://remarkablewiki.com/tech/ssh)
- golang
- scp
- browser (necessary for OAuth2)

## Installation
- create a pocket application: [https://getpocket.com/developer/apps/new](https://getpocket.com/developer/apps/new) to obtain a `consumerKey`. The application only needs the 'Retrieve' permission.

- clone or download this repository
- run:

```
./install.sh
```

## Remarkable software updates
After a reMarkable software update, you will need to rerun the install script:

```
./install.sh
```

## Reinstall

If for some reason you need/want to reinstall pocket2rm completely :

- remove the file $HOME/.pocket2rm
- remove the folder called `pocket` on your remarkable
- run:

```
./install.sh
```

## Improvements
- input consumerKey in popup (removes commandline run)
- provide binaries
- images in epubs
- improve repo structure (duplicate utils, dependencies)

## Non-goals
- support other read-later services / e-reader targets

## Alternatives:
- there is [google-chrome plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/send-to-remarkable/mcfkooagiaelmfpkgegmbobdcpcbdbgh) which sends articles to reMarkable
- reMarkable is planning to release an [offical chrome plugin](https://support.remarkable.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006830977-Read-on-reMarkable-Google-Chrome-plug-in)
